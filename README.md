# README

Building a blog with comments and accounts using Ruby on Rails is a foundational exercise I went through to learn more about the framework. Working together, both Ruby and Rails simplifies the process of making an MVC pattern (Model-Viewer-Controller) built on top of a CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Destroy) approach when working with dynamic data.

To easily demonstrate and cement the principles of full-stack web development I chose to create a blog. The website allows users to create accounts to view and comment on blog posts. There is also an admin account which can create, edit, and delete blog posts. The admin account can also delete comments made by users.
